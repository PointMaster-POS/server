This command will build the Docker images for all services and start them. The --build flag ensures that any changes to the Dockerfile or application code are included in the build.

Step 4: Verify the Services
Once the services are up and running, you can check the logs to ensure everything is working as expected:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f
To see the running containers, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose ps
Service Details
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the services included in the PointMaster system:

API Service: The main service for handling API requests. It communicates with the database and other microservices.
Database Service: MySQL database service used for persisting data.
Auth Service: Handles authentication and authorization for the system.
Notification Service: Manages sending notifications (e.g., emails, SMS).
Each service is defined in the docker-compose.yml file with its respective configuration, environment variables, and dependencies.

Restart Policies
To handle service failures, Docker Compose can be configured with restart policies. Here are some common policies:

no: Do not automatically restart the container.
always: Restart the container if it stops.
unless-stopped: Restart the container unless it has been manually stopped.
on-failure: Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero exit code.
Example restart policy in docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  api:
    image: pointmaster-api
    restart: always
Additional Commands
Here are some additional Docker Compose commands you might find useful:

Stop the services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Rebuild and restart the services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
Run a command in a running container:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec <service-name> <command>
Example to access a shell in the API service:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec api /bin/bash
Troubleshooting
Service Not Starting: Check the logs for any errors that might indicate what went wrong. Use docker-compose logs <service-name> for detailed logs.

Database Connection Issues: Ensure that the database service is running and that the environment variables in your .env file are correctly configured.

Configuration Issues: Double-check your .env file for any missing or incorrect values. Make sure to follow the format provided in the .env.example file.

Network Issues: Ensure that Docker is running and that there are no conflicts with ports used by other applications on your machine.
